# YTCaption - YouTube Transcriber Bookmarklet

Reasons You Will Love YTCaption:

--> Scan the transcript
--> It's finally readable
--> Consume YouTube videos twice as fast!
--> Watch and read so you don't miss anything

Use this with your Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system to extract  content from a YouTube video. Put your atomic notes in a Zettelkasten vault inside Obsidian. Create smart notes from YouTube videos quickly and easily. 

YTCaption was created because there are so many amazing 20 minute to 2 hours videos that we do not have the time to watch. 

So this is the perfect tool to keep on top of all your favourite YouTube Podcasts. 

You won't be believe how useful it is!

Why sit through the whole entire video just to see what the person is going to be talking about when YTCaption can give you a full YouTube transcript? Wouldn't that be nice? 

Load up any YouTube video and just see the script for the video right there.

This is an easy project to follow along with if you want to build your own.
